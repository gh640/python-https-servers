# Python https servers

Examples of an https server for development. They work on Python 3.

## Samples

There're 3 samples.

1. Python standard libraries
2. Gunicorn
3. Gunicorn + Flask

## Usage

### Preparation

Generate a self-signed certificate and name it `localhost.pem`.

```bash
cd python-https-servers/
openssl req -new -x509 -keyout localhost.pem -out localhost.pem -days 365 -nodes
```

### 1. Python standard libraries

```bash
./run-python.sh
```

### 2. Gunicorn

Install the required packages with Poetry or `pip`.

```bash
poetry install
# or
python3 -m pip install gunicorn
```

Then run `run-gunicorn.sh`.

```bash
./run-gunicorn.sh
```

### 3. Gunicorn + Flask

Install the requiredpackage with Poetry or `pip`.

```bash
poetry install
# or
python3 -m pip install gunicorn Flask
```

```bash
./run-gunicorn.sh
```
